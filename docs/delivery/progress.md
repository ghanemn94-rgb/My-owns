# Delivery progress checkpoint

_Updated by the delivery-orchestrator at every step change. On resumption, run `node tools/gates/validate.mjs --reconcile` and `--pipeline` first. Then reconcile this file with `stages.json`, `findings.json` and the latest review round before assigning any write task._

## Current checkpoint

- **Active stage:** P0 / DG0. The round-13 findings are repaired (D-027, AN-13); round 14 is next.
- **Round-13 candidate:** `sha256:c3364ac2f1c27b37bdaef6c07196d25b13016e94703449b9ff87524ff18afb79` (commit `6c61f2e`)

**Review history**

| Round | domain | code-security | QA | New findings |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | FAIL | BLOCKED (classifier outage) | FAIL | 17 (2 High) |
| 2 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 11 (1 High) |
| 3 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 7 (1 High) |
| 4 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 7 Low; 115 reopened |
| 5 | FAIL | (orphaned: runner bug) | (orphaned) | 1 |
| 6 | FAIL | FAIL | FAIL | 5 (bytecode in candidate; 115 back-dating residual) |
| 7 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 4 (132 High: empty-transcript bypass). D-022 prompt-binding defect found by the orchestrator |
| 8 | PASS | PASS | PASS | 1 Low (path with space) |
| 9 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 2 (134 Medium: worktree guard bypass) |
| 10 | PASS | FAIL | PASS | 3 (135/136 Medium: guard fail-open, user settings) |
| 11 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL | 6 (137 High, 226: shell bypasses of the guard). Led to the §0.4 root-cause response: D-025 (OS Bash sandbox) and `threat-model.md` |
| 12 | (orphaned: stub false positive; run PASS) | FAIL | FAIL (run exit 1; does not bind) | 5: 140 Critical (runner imports planted modules), 229 Medium, 230/231/232 Low |
| 13 | PASS | FAIL | FAIL (Low only) | 5: 141 High (sandbox wrapper cloned into agent-writable `$TMPDIR`), 012/142/233/234 Low; 231 reopened |

- **Findings:** 68 closed and verified, 7 fixed and pending verification (F-DG0-012, 141, 142, 231, 233, 234; F-DG0-140 closed in round 13).
- **Round-13 repairs (D-027):**
  - `sandbox-run.sh` does the clone, the checkout and the command inside bubblewrap on a private tmpfs.
  - The config scan reports removals.
  - `meta.cwd` is bound to the transcript.
  - Dependency installation is sandboxed (REQ-DLV-042, DG1).
  - Stale text is removed.
- **Orchestrator practice change:** helper scripts and logs live in a root-only directory, never in the agent-writable `/tmp` or `$TMPDIR`.
- **Record correction:** the DG0 state-history timestamps for rounds 1–12 had been estimates, and several contradicted git. They were corrected from evidence (freeze times, reviewer run finish times), with the old values kept in each note. The missing round-12/13 transitions were added retrospectively and are labelled as such.
- **Next:**
  1. Run the pre-freeze, then freeze round 14.
  2. Run the live probe (the runner changed).
  3. Run the three reviews: domain verifies 012; code-security verifies 141/142; QA verifies 231/233/234.
  4. If all PASS: VERIFYING, release audit, full and historical validation, APPROVE DG0.
  5. Then P1.

## Done in P0 so far

- Located the authoritative source (a session upload), committed it, and made the extraction reproducible: `tools/source/check_extraction.sh` passes.
- Saved the master prompt v2.0 verbatim and split it into 423 anchored blocks.
- Wrote the ten project agent definitions. The invocation mechanism was verified; see `docs/delivery/agents.md` and decision D-003.
- Built the role write guard and its tests (8/8 pass).
- Built the gate tooling: schemas, candidate hashing, validator (`--stage`, `--historical`, `--pipeline`, `--register`, `--reconcile`) and self-tests (15/15 pass).
- Added the CI workflow `.github/workflows/delivery-gates.yml`.
- Wrote delivery records: environment, protocol, register spec, decisions, stages, findings.

## In flight

| Task | Agent | Status |
|---|---|---|
| T-DG0-AN-01: playbook → REQ-PB (92 rows), source coverage (165/165), glossary, field inventory | transformation-analyst | **done** (handback committed) |
| T-DG0-LOAD: load and guard check of all ten agents | all ten | **done**: 10/10 loaded, 10/10 out-of-scope writes blocked |
| T-DG0-AN-02: master prompt §1–§13 | transformation-analyst | running |
| T-DG0-AN-03: preamble, §0 and §14–§21 | transformation-analyst | running |
| P1 stack discovery (read-only, not a delivery task) | built-in research workflow agents | running |

**Deviation, recorded honestly:** during this step, 2 delivery agents and 4 read-only research agents ran concurrently, which is above the §0.2 default of 4 active workers. The research agents write nothing to the repository. No resource contention was observed on the 4 vCPU / 15 GiB host.

## Next actions

1. **AN-02:** master prompt §1–§11 → requirements, coverage, permissions matrix, user journeys.
2. **AN-03:** preamble, §0 and §12–§21 → requirements, coverage, acceptance map, stage plan.
3. **AN-04:** merge the parts into `docs/delivery/requirements.csv` and `docs/analysis/master-prompt-coverage.csv`, then run `validate.mjs --register DG0`.
4. Freeze the DG0 candidate, then run the three independent reviews (domain, code-security, QA) followed by the release audit.

## Unresolved blockers

None yet.

# DG0 assignment: release-auditor (round __ROUND__)

Read `docs/delivery/assignments/DG0/review-common.md` first. Task ID: `T-DG0-AUDIT-R__ROUND__`.

The three specialist records for this round are:
- `docs/delivery/reviews/DG0/round-__ROUND__/domain-reviewer.json`
- `docs/delivery/reviews/DG0/round-__ROUND__/code-security-reviewer.json`
- `docs/delivery/reviews/DG0/round-__ROUND__/qa-verifier.json`

The findings history is `docs/delivery/findings.json`, maintained by the orchestrator from reviewer sidecars.

Perform the audit defined in your agent definition, points 1–7. For DG0 there is no previous gate (`previous_gate: null`). In particular:
- Recompute the candidate: `node tools/gates/candidate.mjs --stage DG0` and `--diff`.
- Verify that each invocation reference against `docs/delivery/runs/DG0/<run_id>/meta.json` is a real, distinct, successful run of the named role. Spot-check each transcript (`zcat … | head`) to confirm the reviewer actually inspected the candidate rather than rubber-stamping it.
- Spot-check that the evidence content supports the claims.
- Check the derived requirement verification: each `final_gate = DG0` requirement is in QA's `requirements_checked` and in the domain or code-security reviewer's.
- Confirm there are no unresolved findings for DG0.

Write your audit record `docs/delivery/reviews/DG0/round-__ROUND__/release-auditor.json`. Then write `docs/delivery/gates/DG0.json` (gate schema) with decision APPROVED **only** if every condition holds; otherwise write BLOCKED and list `blocking_conditions`. Use your invocation reference in both.
- `manifest_path`: `docs/delivery/candidates/DG0.manifest.json`
- `requirements.final_gate_ids`: every register row with `final_gate` DG0
- `tests`: the key executed checks with evidence paths

Finally run `node tools/gates/validate.mjs --stage DG0` and report its output and exit code. If it fails, the gate is not approved. Say so, and don't edit anything to make it pass.

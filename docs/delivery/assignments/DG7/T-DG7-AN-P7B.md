# Assignment T-DG7-AN-P7B: Register pass 2 before the freeze (transformation-analyst)

## Stage and base

- **Stage:** P7 "Independent transfer and release", gate DG7 (BUILDING), branch `claude/mobily-transformation-platform-dg6-regate`, current `HEAD`. Work in the repository root. You run alone.
- **Your task:** Re-assess every DG7 release-blocker row in docs/delivery/requirements.csv against the evidence since your first pass: decisions D-266 and D-267, the host-run logs in docs/delivery/test-evidence/DG7/orchestrator/host/ (container half now PASS), the A27 drill report (test-evidence/DG7/orchestrator/a27/drill-report.md; K11 partial), DO-J2 (secret scans exit 0), BE-F2, DO-E3/E4, ARCH-R7. Promote a row to IMPLEMENTED only on evidence that actually ran; keep the rest as release blockers with the exact missing item (A26 drill, freeze-time protocol audit, gate-only clauses). Do not apply Q19 beyond its six rows (D-266 (d)). Read §1 and §2 of `docs/architecture/p7-work-split.md`, the sections named here in full, the ADRs they cite, `docs/architecture/p7-plan.md` and decisions D-243 onward.
- **Time:** 60–75 minutes. `date -u` at start and end; past about 70 minutes, finish the current file and write the handback listing what remains.

## Environment

Node 24.21.0 at `/opt/nvm/versions/node/v24.21.0/bin`. Offline (`MTH_PNPM_OFFLINE=1`). Ports below 32768. **Disk is tight (about 4 GB free): never make an extra checkout; delete your own temporary trees.** The write guard forbids `tools/gates/**`, `tools/agents/**`, `.claude/**`, `docs/source/**`, review and gate records, `stages.json`, `findings.json`, `test-evidence/**`, `trading_agent/`. No Docker daemon (D-243 Q1).

## Deliverables

Everything your scope assigns to you, with its tests passing, and the pending entries you implement removed from `apps/api/test/support/p7-pending*.ts`. Every mutation has a server-side authorization check, validation, optimistic concurrency where it updates, and an audit event, each covered by a test. Decimal arithmetic for money and rates; Unknown/Stale never shown as zero or green; bilingual texts as the work split gives them.

Then the handback `docs/delivery/handbacks/DG7/T-DG7-AN-P7B-transformation-analyst.md` with five sections: files changed; behaviour per requirement; checks run with their real exit codes; known gaps; open questions. Logs in `docs/delivery/handbacks/DG7/T-DG7-AN-P7B-evidence/`.

## Acceptance

- Every your scope test passes; `pnpm -r typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm openapi:lint` and `pnpm test` exit 0; the integration tests you touch (and the contract test) pass on a disposable PostgreSQL (`tests/qa/support/with-pg.sh`).
- `git ls-files -co --exclude-standard -z | xargs -0 npx prettier --check --ignore-unknown` exits 0.
- `node tools/gates/validate.mjs --historical --stage DG6` exits 0.

Never report a check as passed that did not run. A missing tool is BLOCKED.
